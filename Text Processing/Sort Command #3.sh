#You are given a text file where each line contains a number.
#The numbers may be either an integer or have decimal places.
#There will be no extra characters other than the number or the
#newline at the end of each line. Sort the lines in ascending order
#- so that the first line holds the numerically smallest number,
#and the last line holds the numerically largest number.

#The -n option sorts the file on the basis of the numeric fields available
#if the first word or column in the file is a number.
